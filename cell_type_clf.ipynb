    "**Objective**:\n",
    "The objective of this task is to classify cell type data, which consists of four distinct categories: a, b, c, and others. This problem is framed as a multi-class classification problem, where each sample (an image of a cell) must be assigned one of the four labels based on its features. The dataset is imbalanced, meaning certain classes have far fewer samples than others, which introduces challenges in model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metric Selection**:\n",
    "Given the class imbalance present in the dataset, accuracy alone is not a sufficient evaluation metric. In this context, the weighted F1 score is the preferred metric. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it balances these two metrics to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.\n",
    "Since we have an imbalanced dataset, the weighted F1 score is particularly useful because it gives more weight to the larger classes while still considering performance on the smaller classes. This helps ensure that the model performs well across all classes, not just the majority class, and avoids the bias that could arise from imbalanced class distributions. The weighted F1 score is calculated by averaging the F1 scores of each class, weighted by the number of instances in that class. This approach ensures that the model’s performance on minority classes is not overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Baseline Model**:\n",
    "For a baseline model, we will start with a Random Forest classifier. Random Forest is chosen because it is a robust, interpretable model well-suited for classification tasks, and it performs well on medium-sized datasets. Random Forest does not require extensive hyperparameter tuning and can provide a solid baseline for comparison with more advanced models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvement through Neural Networks**:\n",
    "To improve upon the baseline, we will experiment with Neural Networks (NN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Neural networks, particularly CNNs, are highly specialized for image classification tasks as they can automatically learn hierarchical features and patterns from image data. CNNs have been shown to outperform traditional machine learning models in many image-related tasks due to their ability to capture spatial relationships in images. These models are expected to provide a significant boost in performance compared to the Random Forest baseline."

    "Hyperparameter tuning recommendations for cell type classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learning Rate:\n",
    "   - Initial value: 0.001 (current setting)\n",
    "   - Tuning range: [0.0001, 0.01]\n",
    "   - Justification: The learning rate controls step size during optimization. \n",
    "     Too high may cause divergence, too low leads to slow convergence. The optimal \n",
    "     learning rate depends on the specific dataset characteristics and model architecture.\n",
    "   - Implementation: Use ReduceLROnPlateau callback to dynamically reduce learning rate \n",
    "     when validation metrics plateau.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Batch Size:\n",
    "   - Initial value: 32 (current setting)\n",
    "   - Tuning range: [16, 64]\n",
    "   - Justification: Smaller batch sizes provide more parameter updates and potentially better \n",
    "     generalization but slower training. Larger batch sizes enable better gradient estimates \n",
    "     and faster training but may lead to poorer generalization.\n",
    "   - Implementation: Grid search different batch sizes and measure validation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Network Depth:\n",
    "   - CNN: Test with 2-4 convolutional blocks\n",
    "   - FCNN: Test with 2-5 dense layers\n",
    "   - Justification: Deeper networks can learn more complex representations but require more \n",
    "     data and are prone to overfitting. For 27x27 images, extremely deep networks may be \n",
    "     unnecessary and could lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dropout Rate:\n",
    "   - Current values: 0.25 (convolutional layers), 0.5 (dense layers)\n",
    "   - Tuning range: [0.1, 0.5]\n",
    "   - Justification: Dropout is a regularization technique to prevent overfitting. The optimal \n",
    "     rate depends on model complexity and dataset size. Early layers typically need less \n",
    "     dropout than later layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Number of Filters/Neurons:\n",
    "   - CNN filters: Test [16, 32, 64] for first layer, doubling in each subsequent layer\n",
    "   - FCNN neurons: Test different architectures like [512, 256], [1024, 512, 256], etc.\n",
    "   - Justification: The number of filters/neurons controls model capacity. Too few may \n",
    "     result in underfitting, while too many can lead to overfitting and increased computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Data Augmentation Parameters:\n",
    "   - Rotation range: 15-30 degrees\n",
    "   - Width/height shift: 0.1-0.2\n",
    "   - Zoom range: 0.1-0.15\n",
    "   - Horizontal/vertical flip: True/False depending on cell orientation importance\n",
    "   - Justification: Data augmentation increases effective training set size and improves \n",
    "     model generalization. The parameters should be tuned to match expected variations in the data \n",
    "     while preserving class-specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Early Stopping Patience:\n",
    "   - Current value: 10 epochs\n",
    "   - Tuning range: [5, 15]\n",
    "   - Justification: Patience determines how many epochs to wait for improvement before stopping \n",
    "     training. Too short may stop training prematurely, while too long wastes computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Optimizer:\n",
    "   - Current choice: Adam\n",
    "   - Alternatives: RMSprop, SGD with momentum\n",
    "   - Justification: Different optimizers have different convergence properties. Adam generally \n",
    "     works well for most problems, but alternatives may perform better in specific cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended Tuning Approach:\n",
    "1. Start with learning rate and batch size tuning as these often have the largest impact\n",
    "2. Proceed to network architecture tuning (depth, width)\n",
    "3. Fine-tune regularization parameters (dropout)\n",
    "4. Optimize data augmentation parameters\n",
    "5. Consider ensemble methods combining CNN and FCNN predictions for potentially better performance\n",
